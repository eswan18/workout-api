### Running the API
To start the Restful API service, simply run
```python
python main.py
```
from within the `api` directory.

### Running Tests
Each component (API and front-end) currently has its own tests.
To test the API, first ensure that you have
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) installed.
Then start the API service (see above) and then run
```bash
pytest
```
from within the `api` directory.
